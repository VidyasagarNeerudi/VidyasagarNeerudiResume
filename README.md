Input:
The program's major input is data provided by the user. This input can vary depending on the program's objective, such as numerical figures, text, or files. For example, in a Python program to evaluate Spotify trends, the input might be a dataset comprising song audio attributes such as tempo, danceability, and popularity in CSV or JSON format. Before proceeding, the software checks to see that all inputs are properly structured and legitimate.

Process:
When the software receives the input, it processes it through a sequence of procedures. This could include processing the input, applying logical conditions, and employing algorithms to analyse or change the data. For example, in a music trend study, the application calculates aggregate statistics, visualizes trends, and detects patterns over time. Core Python packages such as pandas and matplotlib can be used for data processing and visualization.

Output:
The software generates output based on the input it has processed. Summarized statistics, visual charts, or actionable insights may be displayed on the console, saved as files, or presented via a user interface. For example, the music trends analysis application might generate graphs depicting tempo and popularity trends over time to assist users in identifying new preferences.
